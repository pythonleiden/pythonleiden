# Meetup Thursday, November 13, 2025

Our sixth meeting, and the final meeting of 2025! The meeting will take place from 20:00 - 22:00. It will be held at
Technolab in Leiden, near the Lammenschans railway station. Pizza starting at 19:15, please read [below](#pizza)!

### Contents of the meeting

At this meeting, we have two talks planned so far. We're still looking for more speakers, so if you'd like to give a talk, please reach out to us!

#### Talk 1: Python and MongoDB, a perfect marriage

by Mathijs Gaastra

In this talk, Mathijs will share his experiences using Python with MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database. He will discuss the advantages of using MongoDB for certain types of applications, and how Python's flexibility and ease of use make it a great fit for working with MongoDB.

#### Talk 2: Deploying Python apps to your own infra with Github Actions

by Michiel Beijen

Learn how to use Github Actions to deploy your Python applications to your own infrastructure. This talk will cover setting up CI/CD pipelines, managing secrets, and best practices for deployment. We'll look at how to use self-hosted runners to make deployment super easy!

#### Talk 3: ... your talk here?

We're still looking for another speaker for a short (5-10 minute) talk. If you'd like to give a talk, please reach out to us!

### About our meetups

Our talks happen in a friendly and informal setting. They are a great way to learn new things, share your knowledge, and meet other Python enthusiasts.
There is always room for questions and discussion.
Our presentations and talks are in English to
be accessible for the large amount of non-Dutch speakers in the Python community.

### Location

Our meeting location is kindly provided by [Technolab](https://www.technolableiden.nl/), an organization that offers
science education for children and teenagers. We're very happy to be able to use their facilities.
We’ll be using the big meeting room, while the
people from "[The Space Leiden](https://spaceleiden.nl/)", a local hacker/makerspace, will also be present in the
building. The Space will be open starting 19:00.

### Pizza

There will be pizza prior to the meetup starting 19:15. The pizza is provided for free to you by our generous food sponsor [Samotics](https://www.samotics.com/).
Check back for pizza details later.

### How to get there

Technolab is located in the building above the Plus supermarket (Bètaplein 28).
This is a 5 minute walk from the Leiden Lammenschans railway station. It’s also easily reachable by bus.

If you travel by car, the best place to park your car is at [Parking Leiden Lammenschans](https://parkingleidenlammenschans.nl/)
which is located in the basement of the building where Technolab is. Parking costs around €2 per hour.

### Price
