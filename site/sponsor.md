# Sponsoring and collaboration

Please note that we are a low profile non commercial user group run by
volunteers. If you would like to sponsor us to get your name out there, it's
really appreciated, but we will not give talk slots to sponsors or stuff like
that.

If you have another idea that sounds interesting, please reach out to
[Michiel](mailto:mb@x14.nl).

If you would simply like to donate some money, as a company or as an
individual, that is very much appreciated, please check out
[Donate to Python Leiden](/donate.html).
