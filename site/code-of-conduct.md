# Code of conduct

Python Leiden User Group events are intended for networking and collaboration
in the developer community.

We value the participation of each member of the Python community and want all
attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all
attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees at all
Python Leiden User Group events.

To make clear what is expected, all staff, attendees, speakers, exhibitors,
organisers, and volunteers at any Python Leiden User Group event are required
to conform to the
[PyCon US Code of Conduct](https://policies.python.org/us.pycon.org/code-of-conduct/).
Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event.

## Contact information

If you believe that someone is violating the code of conduct, or have any other
concerns, please contact an organiser immediately. They can be reached by
emailing <mb@x14.nl> which is monitored by Michiel.

Event organisers and staff will be happy to help participants contact venue
security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist any
attendee to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.
