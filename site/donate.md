## Donating to Python Leiden User Group

We are a volunteer-run user group and we do not charge any membership fees or
event fees.

If you would like to support our activities by donating any amount of money,
that would be greatly appreciated! We use any donations for covering small
presents for our speakers, FINALLY getting those Python Leiden stickers made
you can put on your laptops, and to recover from those Meetup.com fees from
back when the Python Software Foundation was not sponsoring them yet.

### Donation methods
