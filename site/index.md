# Python Leiden User Group

We're a local user group for the Python programming language based in Leiden,
The Netherlands. On our bi-monthly meetings you can exchange knowledge, learn
new things and meet other Python-people. Our meetings are free of charge and
open to everyone. Our presentations and talks are in English to be for the
large amount of non-Dutch speakers in the Python community.

## Next event

Thursday, 13th of November 2025 from 20:00 - 22:00 at Technolab, Betaplein 28,
Leiden.

At this meeting, we have three talks planned:

- Talk 1: **Python and MongoDB, a perfect marriage** by Mathijs Gaastra
- Talk 2: **Deploying Python apps to your own infra with Github Actions** by
  Michiel Beijen
- Talk 3: **Identifying "blast beats" in music using Python** by Lino
  Mediavilla

### About our meetups

Our talks happen in a friendly and informal setting. They are a great way to
learn new things, share your knowledge, and meet other Python enthusiasts.
There is always room for questions and discussion. Our presentations and talks
are in English to be accessible for the large amount of non-Dutch speakers in
the Python community.
