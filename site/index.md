# Python Leiden User Group

We're a local user group for the Python programming language based in Leiden, The Netherlands.
On our bi-monthly meetings you can exchange knowledge, learn new things and meet other Python-people.
Our meetings are free of charge and open to everyone. Our presentations and talks are in English to
be for the large amount of non-Dutch speakers in the Python community.

## Next event

Thursday, 4th of September 2025 from 20:00 - 22:00 at Technolab, Betaplein 28, Leiden.

At this meeting, we have three talks planned:

- Talk 1: **Architecture of the Transformer model, used by Large Language Models such as ChatGPT** by Priyanjali Goel
- Talk 2: **HTMX, the postmodern way of adding modern web features to your app** by Jan Murre
- Talk 3: **Memory Graph: Teaching tool and debugging aid in context of references, mutable data types, and shallow and deep copy** by Bas Terwijn

Our talks happen in a friendly and informal setting. They are a great way to learn new things, share your knowledge, and meet other Python enthusiasts.
There is always room for questions and discussion.
Our presentations and talks are in English to
be accessible for the large amount of non-Dutch speakers in the Python community.
