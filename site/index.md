# Python Leiden User Group

We're a local user group for the Python programming language based in Leiden,
The Netherlands. On our bi-monthly meetings you can exchange knowledge, learn
new things and meet other Python-people. Our meetings are free of charge and
open to everyone. Our presentations and talks are in English to be for the
large amount of non-Dutch speakers in the Python community.

## Next event

Thursday, 22nd of January 2026 from 19:15 - 22:00 at Technolab, Betaplein 28,
Leiden.

At this meeting, we have three talks planned.

- Talk 1: **Simple perfect setup: Handy task runner for data projects.
  Prefect.io** by Reinout van Rees
- Talk 2: **PostgreSQL + Python in 2026** by Aleksandr Dinu
- Talk 3: **PR vs ROC Curves - which to use** by dr. ir. Sultan K. Imangaliyev

If you'd like to give a longer or shorter talk on a future meetup, please
