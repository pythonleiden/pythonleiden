# How to reach Python Leiden meetings at Technolab

Our meeting location is kindly provided by
[Technolab](https://www.technolableiden.nl/), an organization that offers
science education for children and teenagers. We're very happy to be able to
use their facilities.

At the night we meet, the people from
"[The Space Leiden](https://spaceleiden.nl/)", a local hacker/makerspace, will
also be present in the building.

It has been said that our venue, Technolab, is a bit hard to find. But fear
not, we have this page that helps you find your way!

## Address

Technolab Leiden, Betaplein 28, 2333 CW Leiden

## By public transport

Technolab is located near the Leiden Lammenschans railway station. From there,
it's about a 5-minute walk to Technolab. It's also easily reachable by bus.

## By car

If you are traveling by car, the best place to park is at
[Parking Leiden Lammenschans](https://parkingleidenlammenschans.nl/) which is
located in the basement of the building where Technolab is. Parking costs are
around €2 per hour.

## How to get to the venue

A completely overdone list of directions is below. There will also be posters
put up to guide you to the right spot!

- Walk to the Betaplein (at the other side of the railroad tracks from the
  station)
- From the middle of the square, look towards the Plus supermarket
- Outside, on the left side of the supermarket building, you see stairs going
  up. Go up those stairs.
- At the top of the stairs, you will see the entrance to the building right in
  front of you.
- Enter the building and go left immediately.
- at the end of the hallway, enter the staircase through the door on your
  right.
- Go up to two floors (2nd floor).
- At the top of the stairs, turn right and walk to the end of the hallway.
- Enter the big area!! You'll find hackerspace people running the bar. We're in
  the big green meeting room!

## Help out!

If you've read this, we're sure you'll be able to find your way to our venue.
If you see someone on the square looking lost, please ask them if they happen
to be Python people and help them out!
